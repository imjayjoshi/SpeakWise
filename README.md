# SpeakWise (EchoLearn)

AI-powered Language Pronunciation Coach (work in progress).

SpeakWise helps learners practice short phrases, record their speech, and receive feedback on pronunciation, fluency and accuracy. The codebase is split into a frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript) and a backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB).

Current status: In development — core features implemented but polishing, environment configuration and documentation still ongoing.

**Quick Links**

- **Frontend:** `frontend/README.md`
- **Backend:** `backend/README.md`

**Repository structure (top-level)**

- `frontend/` — React + Vite app (TypeScript) for the UI
- `backend/` — Express API, MongoDB models and controllers
- `README.md` — this high-level overview
- `docs/` — screenshots and design assets (partial)
